# M5StickC + FPC1020A Finger Unit

Attached to the grove port, using software serial. 
Primary serial (serial monitor) explains runtime events. 
Further (LCD display etc) customization is an exercise left to you.

On startup, fingerprint memory on the unit will be wiped if button B is pressed on the M5StickC.

Based on previous sketch release (OEM? via Arduino IDE...) - see .ino file for changelog.
